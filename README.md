Instructions to compile and run this JAVA program.

1) Make sure all source code files are in the same directory.

2) If running code from terminal, use following commands to compile and run program when inside directory containing source code files:

Compile code: javac Main.java 

Run code: java Main 

Warning: "java Main.java" may produce an error, if one of the commands to run doesn't work, try the other.

3) If running code in an IDE, please run the Main.java class, which contains the main method that runs all other code in other classes. In order to run program, the option to do so should be on the top bar (maybe under the dropdown menu for "Run" like in IntelliJ, but this depends on your IDE).
